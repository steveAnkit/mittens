# Mittens
This is just a fun project in MEAN stack. It is similar to twitter where you can tweets about meows(cats)

## To get start with this project

First go to the project directory and start Node js server by typing in cmd
:> node server.js

## To start mongodb

Go to :c/data/db and type in cmd

:> mongod

## To connect with mongo server type in cmd

:> mongo

(mittens is the db and meows is the collection for saving meows and users is the collection for saving the user credentials)

* Start your server.js with (nodemon server.js) command. Node will pick the changes automatically
